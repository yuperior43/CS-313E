Instructions:
First, create an NervousSystem object and insert neurons using a character (you can choose any character you wish).
Then, send it a message and accompanying voltage.

Optional: use a queue to have the nervous system perform multiple actions efficiently.

The project is useful for demonstrating the function of a nervous system. Since it is simplified, it allows users to 
understand how messages are transmitted from nerves to an organ or limb as well as what is required for a message to 
be transmitted.
